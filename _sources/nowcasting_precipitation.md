Precipitation nowcasting is a vital tool for decision-making in sectors that depend on timely and accurate weather information. It plays a critical role in disaster preparedness and response, agriculture, aviation, transportation, and urban planning. By providing short-term forecasts with high temporal and spatial resolution, nowcasting enables mitigation of the adverse effects of extreme weather events, such as flash floods and severe storms. In agriculture, it supports irrigation scheduling and crop protection, while in aviation and transportation, it ensures operational safety. As climate change intensifies the frequency and severity of extreme weather, the importance of reliable nowcasting continues to grow across diverse industries.

Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) have driven significant progress in precipitation nowcasting, as highlighted by the five papers reviewed in this document. These works collectively showcase the scientific and societal impact of integrating ML techniques into nowcasting. From introducing state-of-the-art deep learning models like ConvLSTM and NowcastNet to exploring hybrid approaches that combine physical principles with data-driven methods, these studies represent critical strides in improving forecast accuracy and lead times. By addressing challenges such as extreme event prediction, spatiotemporal correlation modeling, and data integration, these papers contribute to the advancement of nowcasting as a practical and transformative tool for society.
